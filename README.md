## ToDo 
- [X] Model Code
- [ ] Figure 1-6 (Results)
- [ ] Figure 7-11 (Sensitivity)

## Glossary
[model_Runge_Kutta.m](https://github.com/LuYuxiaoPKU/MMLS-class-project/blob/main/model_Runge_Kutta.m) : Implementation of the model using the 4th order Runge-Kutta numerical method. This is the same method as in the paper.

[model_ode45.m](https://github.com/LuYuxiaoPKU/MMLS-class-project/blob/main/model_Runge_Kutta.m) : Implementation using matlabs built-in ´´ode45´´ method for numerical approximation. Could be used as controll against Runge-Kutta

[odefcn.m](https://github.com/LuYuxiaoPKU/MMLS-class-project/blob/main/odefcn.m) : Model; there are the equations 1-5 in the Paper implemented to be used in a numerical approximation procedure.
